<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Fair warning, this is a long article that covers a huge array of parkour movements that are taught at LondonParkour which specifically target Military personnel.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >you can use this article as a potential training guide to help guide you with training methodologies, plans or programmes.</p>
<h2 class="text-6xl my-20"  id="Why+Parkour%3F" name="Why+Parkour%3F">Why Parkour?</h2>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Since 2005 we have taught parkour to many various degrees of the military, from British special forces, and American Pentagon officials to Royal Marine Commandos, Army Reserves and everything in between.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Parkour has many components and training philosophies that can be hugely beneficial to anyone, not just soldiers. But it has been observed and experienced that parkour is essentially one of the best ways to refine urban movement because of its definitive results... Since it either works or it doesn't. If it works - we keep using it; tinkering with it and improving upon it. If not, we'll find a different way.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >The environment is our feedback. It's harsh and real and you can either do the movement or not... There is no cheating in parkour.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >For those reasons, it's why our discipline works so well for training soldiers. We only use what works.</p>
<blockquote class="bg-CoolGrey100 p-12 my-12 w-full" >
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >“Absorb what is useful, discard what is useless and add what is specifically your own” Bruce Lee - Wisdom for the Way</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >To clarify how parkour can be beneficial to military units, we've written up a summary of the many topics that can be directly useful and why. Some of these are fundamental basics, others are very advanced techniques that take huge amounts of training to make effective.</p>

This type of movement is called traversing; which involves moving laterally along the wall using both hands and feet in unison. It requires considerable upper body strength, to hold onto the top of the wall, but equally, the hip flexors and abs need to be constantly engaged to keep the feet up high and moving.</p>

<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Dismounting is one of those under-appreciated skills that require training in strength and control. The first issue is getting from a standing position on the wall to a hanging position (or cat position) on the side of the wall. In essence, if performed well, it resembles a reverse (or negative) climb-up.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Following the hang position is the actual drop. This requires you to push away from the wall with either foot or hand to create space beneath you. As you move backwards you will have the ability to look down at your ground target to drop onto. Timing is essential because you need to let go at the apex of the backwards push, so you have maximum distance away from the wall. One hand can remain in front of your head to stop any balance issues with the landing.</p>

<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Dropping with a full view of the landing and with control will allow you to make sure you're landing on the correct part of the foot and not transferring large forces into the spine from heel-striking.

<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >TL;DR - Perform larger drops by redirecting the downward force into a forwards trajectory.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Probably one of the most difficult fundamental movements to get right. Contrary to popular belief, the roll is not used to absorb the impact of a drop, nor is there a one-size-fits-all methodology of performing it. Rather, the roll is used to redirect the downwards momentum (that would normally load the leg muscles with all the force) into a forwards one; which can then be transitioned into some other movement.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >The problem lies in the fact that you need to be able to perform on concrete, perfectly, every time. Otherwise, it's effectively useless because you'll either be loading the leg muscles too much, or the redirected force will hit a bone or joint and will cause damage.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >However, it's also the parkour practitioners super-power. Performed correctly, it will allow you to drop much bigger distances than previously thought safe.

<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >'Breaking a jump' is a catch-all term for overcoming a challenge that scared you. You've essentially broken the fear in your mind.

<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >TL;DR - Fear training helps build mental toughness. Understand how to handle fear in a structured and incremental way through controlled risk.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Fear training is what sets parkour apart from most other sports, pursuits or disciplines. We understand that fear is something to understand, control and actively seek out to overcome. If you're not a little bit scared, then you're doing something comfortable, something you can already do... Which won't progress your ability.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Through managed risk, injecting an incremental (yet small) amount of fear into your training means you'll keep progressing and keep pushing forwards through mental boundaries.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Very rarely is the scary movements a physical problem. It's mostly a psychological one. If the same set-up was created with a soft, comfortable environment, you would no doubt be able to do it... Its the environment and situation that is causing the fear, not the physical ability level. Matching the physical level to psychological level (perform your max in any situation) is every parkour practitioners dream.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Overcoming fear is understanding the process from multiple angles. From experience, anatomically, chemically, bio-mechanically, logically, psychologically, emotionally and reactionary. How you deal with the situation normally, how to overcome the state you're in and move forward by building personal methods to battling it. Understanding exactly what your body is capable of doing and being comfortable with being uncomfortable. Realising which state your nervous system(s) are in and how to influence them.</p>

<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Also, parkour has been shown to give veterans a way to still experience fear which is usually cut away when entering back into civilian life.

<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >More of a specialism in parkour, and only trained by a small subset of practitioners, stealth training has roots in the training of the founders of parkour and original practitioners who felt that parkour was to move anywhere and everywhere, at any time.

<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >The point of stealth training was to challenge the practitioner to have even <em>more</em> control over the body, with greater consequences, through better muscular control.

<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >This also meant that route-setting and planning the journey for avoidance also became a skill in itself.

<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Challenge is the beating heart of parkour. Without it, parkour wouldn't exist. The fundamental driving force behind the creators of parkour was how could they challenge each other each day... And help each other overcome it.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >The whole idea is that without challenge you're not progressing or improving. You're stagnating your growth and skills. The constant challenge, in any shape or form, is what is required to improve as a human being.</p>
<h3 class="text-5xl my-20"  id="Physically" name="Physically">Physically</h3>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >TL;DR - To become better, you should ALWAYS be challenging yourself physically. Parkour is an easy way to add physical challenge to your training.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >The physical challenge is the most obvious topic in parkour. Constantly asking the question &quot;what have I never done, but could try to do and accomplish&quot; is an easy way to look at it. In parkour, that could be a new jump, a different tricky route, a climb, an endurance challenge, a strength challenge, or anything else that tests your physical ability.</p>

<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Understanding what your body is capable of doing and then incrementally going beyond that will help build all physical attributes. It will also help gauge that physical ability. Knowing what you can or cannot do will mean you can accurately judge how easy or difficult a challenge will be. The environmental differences can also act as the challenge - for instance, can you do the same jump in the rain or snow? During a windy day? Day or Night? While other people are around watching you? These are all factors to think about and use to your advantage.</p>

<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Soldiers are no strangers to physical challenges. Most of the training is built around the idea of pushing them to their limits and then beyond. It gets them to become familiar with their bodies and their capabilities.</p>

<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >TL;DR - Rely on your body, not equipment. Improve your physical attributes to become confident in your abilities.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >&quot;Be strong to be useful&quot; is a tagline that's used in parkour quite often. If you're not strong, then it'll be easier to hurt yourself. With parkour the risks are real, the training hard and injuries happen. To compound upon the situation, we don't use any safety equipment because we want to rely on just our own physical body, not external factors. The reason being that we want to be able to spring into action whenever we need to. If you need gloves, or shin-pads, helmets, or any other specialist equipment, you're not very effective.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Our body-armour is our body. Having a strong body will allow you to rely on yourself much more than any equipment could give you.</p>

<h2 class="text-6xl my-20"  id="Adaptability" name="Adaptability">Adaptability</h2>

<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >As parkour practitioners, we tend to think that we can handle many more situations and scenarios that are placed in front of us because that's the way we train daily. To make a more personal point, since 2005 I've never repeated the content of a class twice. Every single class has contained different themes, focuses, techniques, challenges and attributes. This means that students are always required to adapt to the class - whatever it may contain.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Secondly, the content of the class is never explained beforehand either. This is so there is no mental preparation for what's to come. Students must react and adapt to the immediate situation without prior knowledge. For example - if the coach told you before the class that you were going to do 1000 pushups, your mind and body will automatically start preparing for that. Knowing it will be tough means that you'll reserve strength on training before that horrible thing. However, just immediately having to perform the task in the state you're currently in makes you much better prepared to put 100% effort into everything and adapt to the situation.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Some things to note are:</p>
<ul class="text-xl list-outside list-disc mb-12 px-12 pt-12 pb-8 w-full" >
<li class="pb-4 leading-relaxed" >There are no rules - parkour challenges can be anything - it's what makes us versatile.</li>
<li class="pb-4 leading-relaxed" >The environment dictates the way - walls, railings and buildings won't change just because you can't do something. You either can do the move or adapt the route.</li>
<li class="pb-4 leading-relaxed" >Everything changes - The weather, the structures, your emotional state and nervous system, your strength, the surroundings, etc... Over time, everything changes, and should change. Adapting to that is key.</li>
<li class="pb-4 leading-relaxed" >Be ready for anything, at any time - When the time to <strong>need</strong> parkour comes around, you'll be ready. Run from that dog, chase the bus, climb the house because your keys are locked inside, help someone in need, push a car, lift a rock, move a fallen tree, etc... You're ready for that challenge.</li>

<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Just as it is in parkour, military service in war-zones is rarely predictable. You'll be required to think while moving, make decisions and tackle whatever you're up against. Rather than be worried about that next challenge, you'll know that you'll be putting in 100% regardless of what it is. You're always ready and willing to get the job done.</p>

<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >One of the first things that beginner parkour practitioners realise is that we see the possibilities of training all around us. From curbs, lamp-posts, railings, walls, benches, windows, cracks, bricks, signs and everything else around. We see the world differently because we'll constantly be thinking of the multitude of potential ways to move using that object in the form of a challenge.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >The other great side-effect is that we become much more aware of what is physically capable by the human body. It's almost always higher, further and more technically challenging than any normal civilian would think possible. This has been proven through secure facility testing (another service we provide at londonParkour) - Architects and security consultants do not understand real human abilities. Almost all, other than the most secure facilities, are woefully easy to infiltrate - purely because they do not understand how people like parkour practitioners see the world.</p>

<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Longer one or two-day training for section or platoon sizes covering a much larger range of content in parkour. This is an extensive movement workshop that is programmed and planned for your specific requirements.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >The first day will focus upon the fundamentals of parkour movement, the basic techniques and skills we employ; the idea of challenge and adaption; and how to start looking at parkour as a training method.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >The second day will start to look at further fundamental techniques, chaining and movement flow, parkour routes and parkour vision. We'll also be looking at risk, danger and fear; and their role in training parkour - understanding how to inject it into your training safely.</p>

<h3 class="text-5xl my-20"  id="Night+Missions" name="Night+Missions">Night Missions</h3>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Specialist night missions are a parkour experience between sun-down to sun-up. It involves moving through the city at night, exploring, adapting and overcoming challenges as they present themselves.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Note - even though a parkour background is not required, the night missions are very physically and mentally draining that last 8+ hours, and therefore require an adequate level of fitness to keep training for the entire period.</p>

<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Route planning &amp; parkour vision - Learn how to see the world as a challenge and understand what you are physically able to do. Assess potential routes from a distance with the fore-thought of being able to exfiltrate too. Be able to adapt at the moment and understand the factors involved with buildering and climbing techniques.</p>
<h3 class="text-5xl my-20"  id="Physical+facility+penetration+testing" name="Physical+facility+penetration+testing">Physical facility penetration testing</h3>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >What it is - Assessing the potential of bypassing physical security measures. We will help you understand the capabilities of the human body. Can an unauthorised person scale a security wall? Access a roof? Go where they're not meant to? Bypass the razor fence? Climb a building?</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >All of these types of things are what our parkour professionals can help you assess. We'll be able to show you what is possible and what is not possible. We'll be able to give suggestions on how to protect and secure your facility better.</p>

<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >We have no equipment in parkour. Just a pair of trainers. The idea is that the world around us is our gym and most training can be accomplished with simple things like a wall, a fence, a rail, or even nothing at all. We can show you how practical movement training is completely different from all other training because we're doing the exact movement required to overcome that challenge. Conditioning is the key here.</p>
<p class="text-2xl mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Conditioning parkour movements for power, strength, control and all other attributes are what keeps your training fun, enjoyable and easy to implement.</p>
